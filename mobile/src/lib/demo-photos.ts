// styles) — genuinely recognizable as dogs, not abstract gradients.
// Still illustration rather than real photography (no image-generation
// tool or licensed photo source is available in this project's
// environment); see the README for the real-photo swap-in path. Used
// only when a dog has no real uploaded cover photo.
//
// Deliberately untyped (matches every other local require() in this
// codebase, e.g. DogPhoto.tsx's own GENERIC_PLACEHOLDER): RN's asset
// require() returns an opaque module id, and react-native's
// ImageSourcePropType is broader than what every Image prop actually
// accepts (e.g. it allows arrays, which `defaultSource` rejects) —
// annotating it precisely here would fight the library's own types for
// no real benefit.
// Photographs supplied with the KINRO asset pack. Used ONLY for the seeded
// sample profiles (see sample-photos.ts). Placeholder-grade resolution —
// see assets/images/README.md.
