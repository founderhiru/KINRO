 * dashboard) producing a malformed url like "https:///dogs/..." — some
 * platforms never fire an Image's onError for a URI that broken, which
 * would otherwise leave this component stuck silently rendering nothing
 * instead of falling back. Checking up front means the fallback doesn't
 * depend on that callback firing at all — this is deliberate, not just
 * relying on onError (see Phase 6 of the image-implementation notes).

/**
 * Single source of truth for "a dog's photo, or a graceful stand-in" —
 * used anywhere a dog's cover photo appears (Discover cards, My Dog
 * cards, Dog Detail hero, owner profile previews). Photo priority:
 *
 *   1. A real uploaded photo (`uri`), if present and safely loadable.
 *   2. A bundled, recognizable illustrated demo dog, deterministically
 *      chosen from `demoKey` (pass the dog's `slug` — stable for that
 *      dog's whole lifetime, present on both OwnedDogProfileItem and the
 *      public DogProfileItem) — the same dog always shows the same demo
 *      photo, every time, with no storage needed for that assignment.
 *   3. A single generic illustrated placeholder, only when neither of
 *      the above applies at all (no uri AND no demoKey).
 *
 * This ordering (and rendering the fallback synchronously whenever
 * `uri` is absent or fails validation, rather than waiting on a load
 * attempt) is what makes tiers 2/3 render immediately for guests
 * browsing demo dogs — no login, no R2, no network round trip, and no
 * dependence on a remote image ever actually erroring out.
 *
 * Handles the loading/error cases throughout: a pulsing skeleton while a
 * real photo is downloading, and a fallback to tier 2/3 if that download
 * ever fails or the url is malformed. Every tier renders through the
 * same <Image resizeMode="cover"> treatment, so rounded corners (set by
 * the caller via `style` + `overflow: hidden`) apply consistently, and
 * every tier gives the Image a non-zero size because `style` always
 * comes from the caller's own fixed-dimension layout (see PublicDogCard,
 * DogCard, and the Dog Detail heroes for the actual width/height).
