// @polsia:user-owned — server-only transactional email sender (Phase 2).
// Used exclusively by @/lib/auth's magicLink plugin. Deliberately generic
// (subject + text in, nothing OTP/magic-link-specific baked in here) so the
// provider/sender/domain can change later without touching auth logic.
//
// Provider: Resend. In sandbox mode (no verified sending domain yet — see
// .env.example), Resend only delivers to the account's own verified email
// address; every other recipient is silently accepted but not delivered.
// That is expected until KINRO has a verified domain — swap EMAIL_FROM
// to a verified address at that point, no code change required here.
